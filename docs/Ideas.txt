IDEA 1: Concentration Games App (Web/ Android)
    memory game - display a bunch of items on screen then ask if this was on the screen
    show a sequence/ pattern and ask the user to input the same
    math game - fast math game (which of the operations will give the same result)
    reaction game - f1 start light reaction test
    // display bunch of images and have difference

IDEA 2: Maths Worksheet Generator (Web)
    Generate maths questions
    generation based on difficulty
    4 Operations -> +, -, *, / 
    Fractors: LCM, HCF
    Percentage: of, increase, decrease
    *Equation: [
        1 variable equations: 1 step, 2step
        substitution: 2 variables equation
        quadratic
        linear equation with 2 variables
    ]
    Geometry: unit conversion: time, length, weight
    *Speed distance time
    *Pobability: simple events (card, dice, balls in the bag)
    *Statistics: mean, median, mode (data)
    Simple Interest, Compound Interest
